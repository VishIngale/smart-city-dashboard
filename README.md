Smart City Dashboard – Real-Time Urban Monitoring (Coherence'25 Hackathon)

A modern web application built for the Coherence'25 Hackathon under the domain of Web/App Development – Smart City.
This intelligent dashboard provides real-time data visualization and AI-driven insights to support smart city initiatives, helping tackle urban challenges such as traffic congestion, pollution, water management, and energy efficiency.

Problem Statement:
Urban areas are struggling with issues like traffic jams, pollution, and mismanaged utilities. The aim of this project is to design a Smart City Dashboard that integrates and visualizes real-time data collected from IoT sensors, open data APIs, and user feedback, allowing authorities and citizens to take data-driven actions.

Key Features:
📊 Real-Time Data Visualization
Tracks and displays live metrics for:
Air Quality
Traffic Congestion
Water Levels
Energy Usage

🗺️ Google Maps API Integration
Visual mapping of traffic conditions and emergency routes for enhanced situational awareness.

🔔 AI-Driven Alert System
Intelligent notifications and alerts for citizens and administrators based on predictive data analysis.

📱 Responsive Web + Mobile UI
Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices with fast, real-time updates.

Tech Stack:
⚙ Backend
Python (FastAPI)
PostgreSQL (Async)
MQTT (Paho for sensor data handling)
SQLAlchemy (Async ORM)

🖥 Frontend:
React.js (Vite)
Material UI (MUI)
Chart.js (Data visualization)
Leaflet & React-Leaflet (Maps & location data)
Axios (API communication)

Impact:
By providing transparent access to real-time environmental and urban data, this dashboard empowers:
City administrators to make faster, data-informed decisions.
Citizens to stay informed and respond quickly in emergencies.
A foundation for building smarter, more sustainable cities.
